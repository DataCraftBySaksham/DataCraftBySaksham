## 🧑‍💻 Hey there!

This is my corner of GitHub, where I focus on growing in my career, sharpening my technical skills, and building projects that make work more efficient—and more enjoyable.

Here you’ll find:

🔧 Projects I’m building or contributing to

📚 Lessons learned from balancing work, deadlines, and debugging

🌱 Insights for navigating growth in the corporate tech space

Whether you’re here to explore projects, learn something new, or see how someone else is navigating their journey, you’re in the right place.

Let’s connect, learn, and grow—one repository at a time.
You bring the snacks, I’ll bring the code 🍪💻
